/**
 * Amiri Regular font for jsPDF Arabic support
 *
 * This is a placeholder file. To properly support Arabic in jsPDF, you need to:
 *
 * 1. Download the Amiri font from: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Amiri
 * 2. Convert it to base64 using: https://www.giftofspeed.com/base64-encoder/
 * 3. Use jsPDF's font converter: https://rawgit.com/MrRio/jsPDF/master/fontconverter/fontconverter.html
 * 4. Replace this file with the generated font file
 *
 * For now, we'll use the image-based approach which doesn't require font embedding
